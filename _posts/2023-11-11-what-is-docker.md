What is Docker?
Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping, and running applications. It allows developers to build, package, and distribute their applications in a format called a container. This approach has gained popularity in recent years due to its portability, efficiency, and flexibility.

The technology works by creating a container image that contains all the dependencies needed for the application to run. This container can then be deployed on any system that has Docker installed, ensuring consistent behavior across different environments.

Some key features of Docker include:

Isolation: Docker containers are isolated from each other and from the host system, which enhances security and stability.
Lightweight: Containers consume fewer resources compared to virtual machines, which allows for efficient utilization of hardware resources.
Portability: Docker containers can be easily moved between different systems, simplifying application deployment and scaling.
Scalability: Docker makes it easy to create multiple containers from a single image, enabling applications to scale horizontally as needed.
Version Control: Docker allows for easy management of different versions of an application and its dependencies, improving development efficiency and stability.
